# Training for Life versioning

The detailed release decision policy lives in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). In
short:

- **No version** for internal-only or deployment-only work.
- **Patch** (`1.40.1`) for backward-compatible fixes and polish.
- **Minor** (`1.40`) for a new capability, workflow, tab, or substantial
  user-facing redesign; reset the patch component when moving to a new minor.
- **Major** (`2.0`) only after explicit agreement that the core product or
  compatibility contract has changed.

The current published line is `1.39.78`, retained as historical context. The
next release must be classified against the policy above rather than blindly
continuing the patch number. The displayed app version, tests, release notes,
and live deployment must always agree.
